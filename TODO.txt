TODO:

* Add a button to start the 'search for runners'
* When you run a new search, it continues to look at the old list of races for runners - it should stop
* Move the index.php over to api.php or similar
* Put on a loading indicator
* Order the races properly
* Decent default on the dates

Low priority:

* Add a position in category
* Add Date pickers
* Search on 'enter'
* lowercase all the race and result properties
